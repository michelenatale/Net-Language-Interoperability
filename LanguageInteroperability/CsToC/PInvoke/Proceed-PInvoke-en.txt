To build the “cadd.c” file, proceed as follows.

Ensure that the platform is “x64.”

Open Command Prompt, but it must be the x64 native version.
>> Go to the Windows Start menu and enter “x64 Native Tools,” then the correct one should appear.

Once “x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2026” has started, set the path to cadd.c with cd..
>> Change drive to X:
>> cd X:\[..]\NetLanguageInteroperability\LanguageInteroperability\CsToC\PInvoke

With “dumpbin /headers cadd.dll | findstr machine” 
>> you can check what kind of “Command Prompt” it is.

With “cl /LD cadd.c /Fe:cadd.dll”
>> cadd.c is compiled and a cadd.dll is generated.

When asked what kind of build cadd.c is, the only answer is that the cl command does not recognize “release” in the same way as VS2026. 
However, it is a quasi-optimized build, and therefore it can be said that it is a release-like build.

If a VS2026 release build is really required, the command
“cl /LD /O2 /GL /Gy /DNDEBUG cadd.c /Fe:cadd.dll”
can be used. This corresponds pretty closely to a Visual Studio release build.

There is a command “cl /LD /O2 cadd.c /Fe:cadd.dll” that would optimize it even more, but in most cases it is not necessary, and it is not wrong to use it either.
>> /O2 = maximum optimization (corresponds pretty much to release)

For a debug-like build 
“cl /LD /Zi /Od cadd.c /Fe:cadd.dll”
is not actually necessary, but it is not wrong either.
